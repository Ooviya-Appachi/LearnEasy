# LearnEasy

LearnEasy is an Augmented reality based Android Application that provides the Virtual 3D-view of the complicated 2D-images like Heart, Brain, Ear, Thyroid, White Blood cells, Eye.., using Vuforia SDK which is an Augmented Reality Software Development Kit.

3D objects are created using 3D-Maya which is embedded in the App at the time of developing using Unity Software(a Game Engine).  

3D object displayed can be dynamically swapped between two views of the same object using Buttons in the App which is also created dynamically.
    1.With Parts.
    2.Without Parts.

Here I attached the C# code for Swapping the views of Brain and Heart objects using Buttons and screen shots of the application.
